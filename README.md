## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The Stock Price Predictor project aims to forecast stock prices using historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The predictive model implemented in this project utilizes the Support Vector Regressor (SVR) algorithm. Predicting stock prices is a complex task due to various factors influencing the financial markets. The SVR algorithm is chosen for its capability to handle non-linear relationships in data and its effectiveness in regression tasks.

### 1.2 Objectives
Developed a reliable stock price prediction model.
Utilized historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Implemented and fine-tuned a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) algorithm.
Evaluated the model's performance and accuracy.

## 2. Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting stock prices for a specific set of stocks based on historical data. It does not encompass real-time trading or financial decision-making.

## 3. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Yahoo Finance, consisting of historical stock prices, trading volumes, and additional financial indicators. The dataset spans a defined time period, capturing the dynamics of the stock market and allowing the SVR model to learn patterns and relationships for accurate predictions.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
Prior to training the SVR model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Time-series features and relevant technical indicators may be engineered to enhance the model's predictive power.

## 5. Model Development
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm designed for regression tasks. Unlike traditional regression models, SVR focuses on finding a hyperplane that captures the maximum margin of the data points. The key components of SVR include:

Kernel Function: SVR uses a kernel function to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space, making it easier to find a hyperplane that separates the data points.
Epsilon (ε)-Insensitive Tube: SVR introduces an ε-insensitive tube around the predicted values, allowing for a certain level of error. Data points within this tube do not contribute to the loss function, providing robustness to outliers.
Regularization Parameter (C): The regularization parameter, C, controls the trade-off between fitting the training data and maintaining a smooth model. It helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

The SVR model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, learning the underlying patterns and relationships between input features and stock prices. The model's hyperparameters, including the choice of kernel function and regularization parameter, are tuned to optimize performance.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
The effectiveness of the SVR model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and generalization ability of the model.

## 7. Future Enhancements
To further improve the stock price prediction model, future enhancements may include incorporating additional features, exploring different kernel functions, and experimenting with ensemble techniques. Additionally, model interpretability and explainability could be enhanced for better understanding by stakeholders.

## Conclusion
The Stock Price Predictor project leverages the power of Support Vector Regression to forecast stock prices based on historical data. Through careful preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, the project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions, contributing to informed decision-making in the dynamic field of financial markets.
